- Household air pollution from cooking with solid burning fuels **kills millions** every year worldwide, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. 

- Women and children are the majority of these deaths.

- The Clean Cooking Alliance, an NGO operating with the support of the United Nations Foundation, launched in 2010 with the mission of transforming and saving lives by helping people convert to modern fuels and stoves.

- My research identified Angola and India as two examples of countries that have large NGO program focus on clean cooking (Angola) and having major government programs to increase adoption (India), so I wanted to show them on this trend plot to see how they compare to the countries with the highest death rates,
